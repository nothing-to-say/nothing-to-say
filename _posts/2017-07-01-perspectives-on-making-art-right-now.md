We look to the past, tradition, craft, lineage, for good reason. So many people
before us have dedicated their entire lives to the various traditions and
mediums we engage with as creators. It would be foolish to not inform ourselves
before we create as informing is akin to nurturing consciousness…**the larger
the consciousness, the more capable we are of profound creation, generally.**

However, as we inform ourselves with past works and artists, we run the risk of
shifting the semiotic meaning of signifiers within our artwork from being iconic
or indexical to symbolic First I will demonstrate why and how, and later I will
delve into why this could be problematic particularly within most human contexts
in this world right now.

# Semiotics

There are three categories of signs Icon: Analogous to what it is indicating, so
much so that it could be picked up on without explanation. A sign on the road
with an icon of a deer mostly certainly signifies deer, they are analogous and
look alike.

Index: alluding towards what it is indicating, can generally be understood
without explanation if logic is applied. A sign signifying a “turn right”
indicated by a curved arrow.

Symbol: A sign that is **agreed upon** to have a certain meaning,which would be
difficult or impossible to understand without **being in the know.** A peace sign,
for example, would mean close to nothing without one being culturally informed
as to what it signifies.

A rather novel take on these categories of signs that I find to be profound is
the notion that they exist on a gradient, and as culture evolves over time;
Icons can become Indexical, and what is indexical can become symbolic.

Perhaps this example is too easy-pickings, but I believe Schoenberg’s post-tonal
body of work is an excellent example of this shift of iconic and indexical
signifiers being transformed into symbolic signifiers. Furthermore, as the
argument I am making is not in anyway limited to art-making with sound, it is
with regret that my examples are generally always musical, as I do not have the
confidence to speak in depth about other subjects.

Based on Heinrich Schenker’s understanding of CPT (common practice tonal) music,
I believe it to be a profound understanding of the music to state that every
level of a complex and hierarchical CPT work (surface, middle-ground,
background) is a sort of fractal unfolding of the “seed” from which it all
germinates: the psychoacoustic “gravity” between tones…the “beating heart” of
tonal music.

- On the most surface level, sensationally, some tones have a “desire” to
  resolve to other tones, especially within a 12 note system where only some of
  those 12 notes are featured prominently, resulting in a harmonic zone and
  “root” being established. To my knowledge, it is still somewhat up for debate
  how universal and non-cultural this perception of tones is, but in most human
  contexts that exists on this planet right now, one can bet that the vast
  majority of people will have a similar sensational reaction to hearing pitched
  tones within a 12-note system.
- A middleground passage unfolding over a dozen or so measures is simply an
  abstraction of the aforementioned surface-level gravity between tones, usually
  a descending 5 line returning home to 1. Of course many games can be played
  with this interaction, and in later periods a middleground passage may end up
  being far longer due to the return to 1 being playfully avoided. This playful
  delaying of resolution and “return to home” can be found in the background
  level as well in the large-scale journey through harmonic zones (keys), and
  can mostly likely be attributed to the same games we play when engaging in sex
  and masturbation.
- In the background, within the most large-scale workings of a piece, the
  journey of harmonic zones moving away from and returning to the home-key are
  an abstraction of similar games being played with the 5 line.

In this sense,every level within the hierarchy of a CPT work is indexical to
(pointing towards) the level before it, which at its base culminates in the
sensational foundation that is our perception of tones and their “desire” to
resolve. Furthermore, each level is uniform in that it is “games” being played
with this sense of musical gravity.

Many of Schoenberg’s post-tonal works seem to do little to alter the structure,
form, and motivic objects relative to past tonal-works that he was deeply
familiar with, while at the same time completely replacing the “seed” of the
music (sensational and psychoacoustic) with various attempts (serial and free)
to nullify the gravity between tones as the driving force of the music. In his
essay “Schoenberg is Dead”, I believe this is what composer/conductor Pierre
Boulez was referring to when he states that Schoenberg was “trying to legitimize
the tone-row by using it in an old context: form, orchestration, rhythmic
structure. Schoenberg tries to justify one world by the other although they are
incompatible.”

I can guess that there were many factors at play which lead to the creation of
this brand of music, perhaps his affirmation of “evolution” as opposed to
“revolution” and a desire to not completely divorce/alienate himself from both
the past artists and current (at the time) audience of the tradition within
which he created art music. I believe it is fair to say, however, that because
his work carries over aspects of music from the past while removing the very
reason why those aspects came to exist in the first place, those aspects become
symbolic in nature and hinge upon (culturally) “agreed upon meaning” to function
and justify themselves.


Why this is problematic in most human contexts found in the world in which I
write this text:

On the tight rope of existing as an artist, if one seeks to both be informed of
past art, while at the same time existing themselves as a conduit of their
context, culturally reflective and relevant to the human experience they
“represent”…the presence of symbolic components (agreed upon meaning) can
become problematic in walking this fine line, particularly if an artist exists
in a context that is anything like contemporary life.

At this point, I must reference Jean Baudrillard’s 1981 philosophical treatise,
“Simulacra and Simulation”. Many people may be more familiar with this work
through its movie adaption (I say this only half-jokingly), “The Matrix”. In the
film, the virtual reality fabricated by inhuman overlords is a metaphor for the
“simulation” of reality and meaning that is contemporary life, the sort of life
portrayed within the robot-maintained fabrication. In the book, Baudrillard goes
so far as to say that this simulation, maintained by symbols and signs, is not
even a mediation or deceptive mediation of reality…this fabrication simply
indicates that nothing like reality is relevant to our current understanding of
human experience.

Admittedly it is some of the order-creating and maintaining aspects of this
symbolic signification of meaning, our system of timekeeping for example, which
allow for our current way of life (which many believe is an achievement or a
step forward on a linear scale of development). However, with opinionated
passion I argue that **it is this symbolic fabrication, the wool over our eyes,
that allow for mass-exploitation and tremendous human-suffering to occur
unchallenged.** Furthermore, growing up in such a world is suffocating in my
view, as this way of life does not come naturally to the human body and
consciousness, and that the two must contort uncomfortably to accommodate such
an existence. This parallels the conundrum of mass-production, wherein tools and
furniture that used to be created for personal use would bend their proportions
to the user, and after the advent of the factory the user would bend to
accommodate the proportions of mass-produced items. In other words, the
consciousness experience of being conditioned to become a functioning
contributor to society and economy is far-removed from the baseline
consciousness experience we experience as children.

In his book, Baudrillard lists five primary reasons as to why this fabricated
reality comes to exist:

> 1. Contemporary media including television, film, print, and the internet,
>    which are responsible for blurring the line between products that are
>    needed (in order to live a life) and products for which a need is created
>    by commercial images.
2. Exchange value, in which the value of goods is based on money (literally
   denominated flat currency) rather than usefulness, and moreover usefulness
   comes to be quantified and defined in monetary terms in order to assist
   exchange.
3. Multinational capitalism, which separates produced goods from the plants,
   minerals and other original materials and the processes (including the people
   and their cultural context) used to create them.
4. Urbanization, which separates humans from the nonhuman world, and re-centres
   culture around productive throughput systems so large they cause alienation
5. Language and ideology, in which language increasingly becomes caught up in
   the production of power relations between social groups, especially when
   powerful groups institute themselves at least partly in monetary terms.

**Personally,** I cannot imagine the justification for any art being created in a
context intertwined with the above reasons to further reinforce a symbolic
reality, artwork which hinges on “agreed upon meaning”. Instead, again in my
view, everything about this context calls for art to subvert and question
“agreed upon meaning”, and create room for **true meaning** to germinate. **In that
sense, a primary method of subversion can be for art to serve as an escape, an
opportunity to connect with something sensationally real, a moment of conscious
sobriety.**

As a composer, I find Georg Friedrich Haas’ works to be the perfect example of
this perspective on art-making. Contrary to a tradition so steeped in formalism
and complexity (both elements which could potentially encroach upon “agreed upon
meaning”), he constantly asserts that “it is all about the sound” when
interviewed. A closer look at any of his works reveals this to be true, and in
my next body of text, I will be taking that closer look. Stay tuned.
